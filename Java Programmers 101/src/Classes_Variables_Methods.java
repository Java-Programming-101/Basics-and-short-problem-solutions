	 * To declare a variable you first have to declare the data type. In this case the
	 * data type is int (Integer).
	 * 
	 * you then have to give the Variable a relevant name.
	 * 
	 * finally you then should declare the initial value of the Variable using the '=' operator.

			*The return type—the data type of the value returned by the method, or void if the method does not return a value.
			*The method name—the rules for field names apply to method names as well, but the convention is a little different.
			*The parameter list in parenthesis—a comma-delimited list of input parameters, preceded by their data types, enclosed by parentheses, (). If there are no parameters, you must use empty parentheses.
			*An exception list—to be discussed later.
			*The method body, enclosed between braces—the method's code, including the declaration of local variables, goes here.
