	 *  double: floating point integer 
	 *   Its range of values is beyond the scope of this discussion, but is specified in the Floating-Point 
	 *   Types, Formats, and Values section of the Java Language Specification. For decimal values, this data

	 *   precise values, such as currency.
	 *   
	 *  boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false. 
	 *   Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false conditions. 
	 *   This data type represents one bit of information, but its "size" isn't something that's precisely 
	 *   defined.
	 *   
	 *  char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. 
	 *   It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535).
